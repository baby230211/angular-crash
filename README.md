# AngularCrash

1. UiService is somehow like redux to manage the global state

2. TaskService is how to communicate with backend with Observable and httpClient

3. jsonServer to mock backend server

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
